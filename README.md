# Flu-Shot-Learning-Predict-H1N1-and-Seasonal-Flu-Vaccines

Data is from Driven Data Labs Competition: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/

I built here multiple Boosted Tree models and tried out the obsolete Sci-kit Optimize tuner and the Optuna tuner.
At least in this case the Sci-Kit Optimizer delivered better results.

Also, I experimented here with the new capabilities of Polars.
